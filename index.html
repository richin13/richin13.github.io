        <div>
          I am Jr. Full stack software developer that immediately felt in love with GNU/Linux and programming
          <span id="how-many-years-ago"></span> years ago.
          I taught myself to code at the age of 16 and have been in love with it since.
          Back in high school, I was learning HTML and CSS, it was cool but I wanted more dynamism for my project,
          that's when I first met a programming language: PHP.
          Since I started studying at Universidad de Costa Rica, I have used an overwhelming number of technologies and
          stacks, ones really awesome and others not so much. From the Assembly x86 to the most awesome and
          syntactically-beautiful programming language: Python <span class="red">❤</span><br>
          I also have a second big love: GNU/Linux and specifically Arch Linux operating system. I do maintain a couple
          of
          packages at <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org">AUR</a> just because I love Arch, open source and because it's
          fun.
        </div>
        <h2 class="header">My experience</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            At the moment, I am fourth-year <i data-tooltip="It's actually called ''Business computing'' but I don't like
          how that sounds!" data-inverted>Software Engineering</i> student at Universidad de Costa Rica.
            Throughout these years, I have faced three major projects in which I have had important roles in planning,
            analysis, design and construction stages of software development.
          </p>

          <ul class="list">
            <li class="item"><strong>Aug. 2016 - Nov. 2016</strong> Parking administration system for <i>Organismo de
              Investigación Judicial</i> for which I elicited requirements, and participated actively in the
              construction
              phase. This project was built with Visual Basic .NET and Bootstrap
            </li>
            <li class="item"><strong>Mar. 2017 - Jun. 2017</strong> Asset management system for <i>Universidad de Costa
              Rica</i> at Paraíso's campus. For my role as a project coordinator I have actively participated in client
              meetings but also in the analysis, design and construction stages of the application. I was built with
              Ruby
              on Rails and Bootstrap. Additionally, an extra module was built with Java for the Android platform.
            </li>
            <li class="item"><strong>Apr. 2017 - Present</strong> Billing system for <i>Asociación de Vecinos de Las
              Vueltas
              de Tucurrique en Pro de los recursos naturales</i>. This project is being built by myself as part of my <i
                data-tooltip="Community work" data-inverted>TCU</i>. As part of my obligations and due to the current
              state
              of the software development process, I have attended meetings with the client, elicited requirements and
              created
              prototypes. The software is being built with Python using Django Web Framework and SemanticUI.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Also, I have developed other solutions that involved several technologies such as Spring Framework, PHP, and
            C++ for backend operations combined with ReactJS, BackboneJS and Handlebars for frontend development.
            Even though those were not formal projects with all the stages of the SDLC, I learned a lot from those
            experiences and that is mainly why I consider myself a Junior Full Stack Software Developer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some of those mini-projects are available online:
            <a href="http://naive-fly.herokuapp.com/" title="Built with Python and SemanticUI">Naive fly</a> is a web
            application that uses the Bayes theorem to classify students, professors and computer networks.
            <a href="https://richin13.github.io/expert-tourist/" title="Built with Python and MongoDB">Expert
              Tourist</a>
            is a RESTful API that computes and recommends touristic routes based on user-defined preferences.
            Those for whose its live version is not available online, the source code will probably be in my Github account.
