## Side Projects & Experiments

### N8N Workflow Automation

Lately I've been working with n8n to build workflow automations for personal projects and to streamline my daily tasks and those of my small businesses.

Some workflows are:

- **Automatic handling of electronic invoices**: I receive invoices via email, and n8n automatically saves them to a platform I developed.
- **Telegram bot AI agent**: I built a Telegram bot that uses n8n and a custom AI agent to casually chat.

- **Technologies**: n8n, Python, AI
- **What I Learned**: How to build and deploy workflow automations with n8n, how to self-host n8n, and how to integrate it with other services.
