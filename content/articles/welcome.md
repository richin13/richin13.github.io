Summary: Welcome to my newly redesigned personal website and blog built with Pelican and Tailwind CSS.

# Welcome to My Redesigned Website

I'm excited to share my newly redesigned personal website and blog. This site is built with [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), a static site generator written in Python, and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Why Pelican?

Pelican is a fantastic static site generator that allows me to:

1. Write content in Markdown
2. Customize the site with Jinja2 templates
3. Generate a fast, secure static website
4. Deploy easily to GitHub Pages

## Features of This Site

The new design includes:

- Clean, minimalist aesthetic
- Responsive layout for all devices
- Dark mode support
- Improved typography with custom fonts
- Fast loading times

## Code Example

Here's a simple Python function:

```python
def greet(name):
    """Return a personalized greeting."""
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to my website."

# Let's test it
print(greet("visitor"))
```

## What's Next?

I plan to regularly update this blog with:

- Technical tutorials
- Project updates
- Thoughts on software development
- Useful resources I discover

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
